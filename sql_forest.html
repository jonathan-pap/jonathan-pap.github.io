								Using SQL, I explored a data set to assess the effect of deforestation between 1990-2016. The mission to reduce deforestation<br \>
								around the world and which raises awareness about this important environmental topic. at the end of the article I will share the SQL scripts.<br \>

							<h2>Report for Forest Query into Global Deforestation, 1990 to 2016</h2>

							<p><h3>1. GLOBAL SITUATION</h3>
								According to the World Bank, the total forest area of the world was <strong>4128269.90</strong> in 1990. As of 2016, the most recent year for which data was available, 
								that number had fallen to <strong>39958245.90</strong> a loss of <strong>1324449</strong>, or <strong>3.2%</strong>.
								The forest area lost over this time period is slightly more than the entire land area of Peru listed for the year 2016 (which is 1279998.72 sqkm).
							</p>
							<p>
								<h2>2. REGIONAL OUTLOOK</h2>
								In 2016, the percent of the total land area of the world designated as forest was <strong>31.37</strong>. 
								The region with the highest relative forestation was <strong>Latin America & Caribbean</strong>, with <strong>46.16%</strong>, and the region with the lowest relative forestation was 
								<strong>Middle East & North Africa</strong>, with <strong>2.07% </strong>forestation.
							</p>	
							<p>
								In 1990, the percent of the total land area of the world designated as forest was <strong>32.42</strong>.The region with the 
								highest relative forestation was <strong>Latin America & Caribbean</strong>, with <strong>51.03%</strong>, and the region with the lowest relative forestation was 
								<strong>Middle East & North Africa</strong>, with <strong>1.78%</strong> forestation.

								The only regions of the world that decreased in percent forest area from 1990 to 2016 were <strong>Latin America & Caribbean</strong> (dropped from <strong>51.03% to 46.16%</strong>) 
								and <strong>Sub-Saharan Africa</strong> (<strong>30.67% to 28.79%</strong>). All other regions actually increased in forest area over this time period. However, 
								the drop in forest area in the two aforementioned regions was so large, the percent forest area of the <em>world decreased</em> over this time period from <strong>32.42% to 31.37%</strong>.
							</p>

							<p>
								<h2>3. Country Level Details</h2>
								<h4 style="margin-left: 40px">A. Success Stories</h4>
								There is one particularly bright spot in the data at the country level, <strong>China</strong>. This country actually increased in forest area from 1990 to 2016 by <strong>527229</strong>. 
								It would be interesting to study what has changed in this country over this time to drive this figure in the data higher. 
								The country with the next largest increase in forest area from 1990 to 2016 was the <strong>United States</strong>,
								but it only saw an increase of <strong>79200</strong>, much lower than the figure for <strong>Iceland</strong>.
							</p>
							<p>	 
								<strong>China and United States</strong> are of course very large countries in total land area, so when we look at the largest percent change in forest area from 1990 to 2016,
								we arenâ€™t surprised to find a much smaller country listed at the top. <Strong>Iceland</Strong> increased in forest area by <strong>213.66%</strong> from 1990 to 2016.
								<h4 style="margin-left: 40px">B. LARGEST CONCERNS</h4>
								Which countries are seeing deforestation to the largest degree?<br \>
								We can answer this question in two ways.First, we can look at the absolute square kilometer decrease in forest area from 1990 to 2016. 
								The following countries had the largest decrease in forest area over the time period under consideration:

							<p>
								When we consider countries that decreased in forest area percentage the most between 1990 and 2016, we find that four of the top 5 countries on the list are in the region 
								of <strong>Sub Saharan Africa</strong>. The countries are <strong>Togo, Nigeria, Uganda, and Mauritania</strong>. The 5th country on the list is <strong>Honduras</strong>, which is in the Latin America region.
							</p>
							<p>
								From the above analysis, we see that <strong>Nigeria</strong> is the only country that ranks in the top 5 both in terms of absolute square kilometer decrease in forest as well as percent decrease in
								forest area from 1990 to 2016.Therefore, this country has a significant opportunity ahead to stop the decline and hopefully spearhead remedial efforts.

							<h2>5.Recomendations</h2>
							<p>For the period of 1990 â€“ 2016 forest area has shrunk by <strong>3.2%</strong>, <em>(1324449 kmsq)</em>, although there is a shrinkage, countries like China and United states 
								have increased forest area over the same period. While there is this increase the total forest area is <em>still shrinking</em>,
								countries in the region of Sub-Saharan Africa has been shrinking the fastest and should be a main focal point.<br \><br \>

								To conclude; through what ever reasons be it Deforestation by humans, wild fires or climate change we need to act faster in replenishing the forest areas.
