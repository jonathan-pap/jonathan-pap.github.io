I am a Business Analyst with a passion for leveraging data to drive business performance and operational efficiency. In my current role, I specialize in designing and deploying dashboards that provide actionable insights into key performance areas such as productivity and profit & loss (P&L). My data-driven analyses help executives and stakeholders streamline decision-making by clearly identifying challenges, uncovering opportunities, and recommending strategic solutions.

With a proactive, resourceful approach, I consistently seek ways to improve processes and outcomes, even in the face of challenges. I am committed to continuously expanding my expertise in analytics, regularly engaging in online learning and professional development to stay ahead of industry trends and technologies.
